<h1>More about me</h1>
<p>
    I've been passionate by computers since I was young. Haven't thought of started programming earlier because I couldn't understand how to read code and the creation of it seemed way overwhelming. After working at Testronic as Video Game Tester, I actually started looking around the code to understand how a game works and see if there's any "behind the scene" issues.
</p>
<p>
    Fast-forward one later, and due to unforseen circumstances (Testronic Bucharest is shutting down), I have started a course to learn how to make my own sites. I don't know what I'm doing yet, but someday I will.<br/>
    Learning never ends
